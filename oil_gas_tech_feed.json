                "full_text": "This week, leaders across Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., Wall Street, and beyond have been thrown into disarray due to the unexpected rise of the Chinese AI company DeepSeek. DeepSeek recently released AI models that rivaled OpenAI’s, seemingly for a fraction of the price, and despite American policy designed to slow China’s progress. As a result, many analysts concluded that DeepSeek’s success undermined the core beliefs driving the American AI industry—and that the companies leading this charge, like Nvidia and Microsoft, were not as valuable or technologically ahead as previously believed. Tech stocks dropped hundreds of billions of dollars in days. But AI scientists have pushed back, arguing that many of those fears are exaggerated. They say that while DeepSeek does represent a genuine advancement in AI efficiency, it is not a massive technological breakthrough—and that the American AI industry still has key advantages over China’s. “It’s not a leap forward on AI frontier capabil..."

But amid all the talk, many overlooked a critical detail about the way the new Chinese AI model functions—a nuance that has researchers worried about humanity’s ability to control sophisticated new artificial intelligence systems. It’s all down to an innovation in how DeepSeek R1 was trained—one that led to surprising behaviors in an early version of the model, which researchers described in the technical documentation accompanying its release. During testing, researchers noticed that the model would spontaneously switch between English and Chinese while it was solving problems. When they forced it to stick to one language, thus making it easier for users to follow along, they found that the system’s ability to solve the same problems would diminish. That finding rang alarm bells for some AI safety researchers. Currently, the most capable AI systems “think” in h..."

On recent analyst calls, executives have increasingly fielded questions about the Chinese AI upstart and what its more cost-effective model means for their businesses. The name DeepSeek was mentioned in at least nine earnings calls last week, according to an AlphaSense search, with only a single mention prior to the company's bombshell announcement about its AI models. That number has grown as major tech companies including Alphabet, AMD, Palantir, and Amazon report their earnings.

Advanced technologies are redefining wellsite operations, from sophisticated coiled tubing techniques navigating complex well profiles, to new wireline technologies—such as NOV’s DXtra™ intelligent wireline—which allow for real-time operational feedback.

                "full_text": "President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of “unleashing U.S. energy dominance,” but the reality is that the United States has already achieved this goal. Over the past decade, the U.S. has cemented its position as a global energy leader, excelling in production, innovation, and influence. Here’s a closer look at the evidence behind America’s energy dominance. Since 2018, the U.S. has been the world’s top oil producer, outpacing both Saudi Arabia and Russia. In 2023, U.S. crude oil plus condensate production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day (BPD), driven by the shale revolution. Technological advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling unlocked vast reserves in regions like the Permian Basin and Bakken Formation, transforming the U.S. into an energy superpower. Beyond crude oil, the U.S. also leads in broader categories, including natural gas liquids (NGLs). In 2023, the U.S. accounted for 15.6% of global oil production, with total output (including NGLs) r..."
