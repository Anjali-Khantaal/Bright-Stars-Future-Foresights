Offshore Wind Scotland estimates developers will be splashing out £50 billion to build 25GW of offshore wind capacity, making a whirlwind of cash available for port operators, blade manufacturers, vessel operators – as well as the providers of everything that happens below the waterline. This includes moorings, anchors, cables, connectors and buoyancy systems – not to mention survey, sensing technology and data measuring the movement of the waves and the volume of fish. Luckily, much of the subsea technology that will build the wind farms has largely been developed for that other North Sea energy industry – oil and gas – which pioneered the skills and technology to produce tens of billions of barrels in one of the world’s harshest environments over the last 50 years.
